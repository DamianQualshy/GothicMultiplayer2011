## 📖 About

Gothic Multiplayer is a fan-made multiplayer modification for Gothic 2: Night of the Raven that allows players to experience the world of Gothic together. Originally released in January 2011, this project has been improved with various fixes and enhancements since 2022, but the majority of its code is still quite dated.

⚠️ Development status: The current development version is a work-in-progress and may be unstable or not playable. Expect bugs, crashes, incomplete features, and breaking changes.

> **Historical Note**: To see the code close to its original 2011/2012 release state, check out the [v0.2b tagged version](https://github.com/Pinemarten/GothicMultiplayer/tree/v0.2b).

## 🔧 Prerequisites

Before building or running Gothic Multiplayer, ensure you have:

### For Building
- **[xmake](https://xmake.io/)** - Modern build system and dependency manager
  - Visit the [xmake installation guide](https://xmake.io/#/guide/installation) for your platform
- **Git** - For cloning the repository
- **C++ compiler that supports C++20** - e.g., Visual Studio 2022 (Windows)

### For Running
- **Gothic 2: Night of the Raven** - Original game with 2.6 (fix) patch
  - Must be a legitimate copy of the game
  - Ensure it's properly patched to version 2.6

### Recommended Tools
- **Git Bash** (Windows users) - For better command-line experience
- **PowerShell** (Windows) - Alternative terminal option

## 🏗️ Building from Source

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pinemarten/GothicMultiplayer.git
cd GothicMultiplayer
```

### 2. Build the Project
```bash
xmake
```

### 3. Build Specific Components (Optional)
```bash
# Build only the launcher
xmake build GMPLauncher

# Build server only
xmake build GMP_Serv

# Build client only  
xmake build GMP_Client
```

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Install to Gothic 2 Directory
Replace the path below with your actual Gothic 2: Night of the Raven installation directory:

```bash
xmake install -o "C:\Program Files (x86)\Gothic II"
```

**Common Installation Paths:**
- Steam: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Gothic II`
- GOG: `C:\GOG Games\Gothic II Gold`
- Retail: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Gothic II`

### 2. Verify Installation
After installation, you should find:
- **Server**: `[Gothic2Directory]\GMP_Server\` - Contains server executable and config files
- **Client Launcher**: `[Gothic2Directory]\Multiplayer\GMPLauncher.exe`
- **Client Runtime**: `[Gothic2Directory]\Multiplayer\Runtime\` - `GMP.dll`, `znet.dll`, `SDL3.dll`, `BugTrap.dll`, and `discord_game_sdk.dll` (all required)
- **Client Configuration**: `[Gothic2Directory]\Multiplayer\GMP_Config.toml` - Created on first launch

The launcher locates these paths from its executable location and starts `System\Gothic2.exe` with `System` as the working directory. Shortcuts should point to `Multiplayer\GMPLauncher.exe`; their "Start in" directory does not affect the default game or runtime paths. Gothic's own files, including `Shw32.dll`, stay in `System`.

The runtime updater downloads `GMP.dll` and `znet.dll` into `Multiplayer\Runtime`. Other runtime DLLs are supplied by the installer. Installing `ClientMain` also installs the launcher and networking runtime.

## 🎮 Usage

### Starting the Server
1. Navigate to your Gothic 2 installation directory
2. Go to the `GMP_Server` folder
3. Configure server settings in the provided configuration files
4. Run the server executable

### Starting the Client
1. Navigate to `[Gothic2Directory]\Multiplayer\`
2. Launch `GMPLauncher.exe`
3. Connect to a server that you previously started.

For development layouts, pass `--gothic` and `--dll` to select the game executable and `GMP.dll`. Each relative argument is resolved against the invoking directory; `--workdir` only changes the child's working directory. The default child directory is the selected game executable's directory. All GMP runtime dependencies must be alongside the selected DLL.

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite to ensure everything is working correctly:

```bash
xmake test
```

This will build and execute all test cases.
